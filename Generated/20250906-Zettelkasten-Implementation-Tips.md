# Zettelkasten Implementation Tips

## Note Naming Convention

Use a consistent format for all notes to enable easy sorting and retrieval:

**Format**: `YYYYMMDD-Topic-Subtopic`

### Examples:
- `20250906-Zettelkasten-Implementation-Tips`
- `20250907-Python-Async-Patterns`
- `20250908-Economics-Supply-Demand`

## Writing Guidelines

### Be Brief but Complete
- Write as if fitting content on an index card
- Capture the complete idea without unnecessary elaboration
- Include enough context for future understanding

### Clear and Descriptive Titles
- Titles should convey the note's core concept
- Avoid vague titles like "Thoughts on X"
- Make titles searchable and memorable

## Maintenance Practices

### Weekly Reviews
1. **Update connections** - Add new links as understanding evolves
2. **Prune outdated content** - Remove or archive obsolete notes
3. **Identify gaps** - Note areas needing development
4. **Strengthen weak links** - Add context to unclear connections

### Progressive Development
- Start with rough notes and refine over time
- Don't wait for perfection before creating notes
- Let understanding emerge through iteration

## Building Connections

### The 2-3 Rule
Every new note should connect to at least 2-3 existing notes:
1. **Source connection** - Where the idea came from
2. **Concept connection** - Related ideas or principles
3. **Application connection** - How the idea might be used

### Connection Types to Use:
- **Supports** - Evidence or examples
- **Contradicts** - Opposing viewpoints
- **Extends** - Building on ideas
- **Applies** - Practical implementations
- **Questions** - Open problems or uncertainties

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Information Dumping** - Copy-pasting without processing
2. **Orphan Notes** - Creating notes without connections
3. **Over-Engineering** - Complex systems that discourage use
4. **Neglecting Maintenance** - Letting the system decay
5. **Category Obsession** - Forcing rigid hierarchies

## Getting Started

### First Week:
1. Create 5-10 atomic notes on familiar topics
2. Focus on making connections explicit
3. Don't worry about perfect organization

### First Month:
1. Develop first structure note after 20+ notes
2. Establish weekly review routine
3. Experiment with different connection types

### Ongoing:
1. Trust the emergent structure
2. Focus on quality over quantity
3. Let the system grow organically

## Key Success Factor

> "The best Zettelkasten is the one you actually use."

Consistency matters more than perfection. Regular small contributions compound into profound knowledge structures.
