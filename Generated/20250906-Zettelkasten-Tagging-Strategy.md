# Zettelkasten Tagging Strategy

## Object Tags Over Topic Tags

The most effective tagging strategy focuses on **specific objects and concepts** rather than broad topics. This prevents tag bloat and maintains precision as your system grows.

### Example:
- ❌ Bad: #health, #technology, #business
- ✅ Good: #insulin-sensitivity, #react-hooks, #compound-interest

## Workflow Tags

Workflow tags track the **processing status** of notes, helping manage the ongoing development of your knowledge base.

### Common Workflow Tags:
- #to-process - Raw notes needing refinement
- #needs-review - Notes requiring verification or updates
- #completed - Fully processed and integrated notes
- #waiting-for - Notes dependent on external information

## Tagging Principles

### Sparse Selection
- Choose tags carefully and minimally
- Each tag should serve a specific retrieval purpose
- Avoid tagging for the sake of tagging

### Multiple Dimensions
- Use multiple tags to capture different aspects of an idea
- Allow notes to exist in multiple contexts simultaneously
- Tags complement but don't replace connections

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-reliance on tags** instead of meaningful connections
2. **Broad topic tags** that become bloated over time
3. **Rigid hierarchical categories** that limit flexibility
4. **Using tags as the primary organization method**

## The Role of Tags in Zettelkasten

Tags serve as **supplementary navigation aids**, not primary organizational structures. The real organization comes from the network of connections between notes.
