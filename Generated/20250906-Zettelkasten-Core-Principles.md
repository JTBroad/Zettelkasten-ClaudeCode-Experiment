# Zettelkasten Core Principles

## Atomicity

The fundamental principle of atomicity means each note should contain **exactly one idea**. This constraint forces clarity of thought and enables precise linking between concepts.

### Key Aspects:
- Keep notes focused and concise
- Think of fitting content on a physical index card
- One idea per note enables precise linking to specific concepts
- Atomic notes are easier to connect and reuse in different contexts

## Connectivity

The second core principle emphasizes building a **web of knowledge through meaningful connections**. The Zettelkasten's power emerges from the relationships between ideas, not from the ideas in isolation.

### Key Aspects:
- Links are more important than tags or categories
- Each new note should connect to at least 2-3 existing notes
- Connections create emergent understanding and unexpected insights
- The web grows organically as knowledge accumulates

## Why These Principles Matter

Together, atomicity and connectivity transform isolated information into a living network of knowledge. Atomic notes provide the building blocks, while connections create the architecture of understanding.
