# Zettelkasten Structure Notes (Hub Notes)

## Definition and Purpose

Structure notes, also called hub notes or maps of content, serve as **navigational waypoints** in your Zettelkasten. They provide overview and organization without imposing rigid hierarchy.

## When to Create Structure Notes

Create a structure note when:
- You have 10+ notes on a related topic
- You're losing overview of a subject area
- You need to organize a complex domain
- You want to create multiple entry points to a topic

## Anatomy of a Structure Note

### Essential Components:
1. **Topic Overview** - Brief description of the domain
2. **Subtopic Organization** - Logical grouping of related notes
3. **Annotated Links** - Links with descriptions of what each note contains
4. **Cross-References** - Connections to other structure notes
5. **Development Status** - Areas needing expansion or revision

- [Neural Networks](./20250903-Neural-Networks.md) - Deep learning foundations

## Unsupervised Learning
- [Clustering Methods](./20250904-Clustering-Methods.md) - K-means, hierarchical clustering

## Structure Notes vs Categories

Structure notes create **heterarchy** (flexible, multiple hierarchies) rather than rigid categories:

- Notes can appear in multiple structure notes
- Relationships are explicit and contextual
- Organization evolves with understanding
- No forced single-parent relationships

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates** - Review and revise as new notes are added
2. **Multiple Perspectives** - Create different structure notes for different views of the same content
3. **Descriptive Annotations** - Don't just list links; explain their relevance
4. **Limit Depth** - Keep structure notes relatively flat (2-3 levels max)
5. **Cross-Link Structures** - Connect related structure notes to each other

## The Role in Navigation

Structure notes act as a **"compass"** when you feel lost in your Zettelkasten, providing:
- Quick overview of a domain
- Multiple entry points to topics
- Context for individual notes
- Discovery of unexpected connections
